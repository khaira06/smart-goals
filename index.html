    <h2>SMART Goals</h2>

    <div class="goal">
        <h3>Goal 1 – Improve Customer Satisfaction</h3>
        <p><strong>SMART Goal:</strong> From January 1, 2025, to December 31, 2025, we will improve our HDI SCS Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) score by 5 percentage points (from 86% to 91%) by focusing on better communication, agent coaching, and consistent follow-up with end users.</p>
        <p><strong>Measurement:</strong> Progress will be tracked monthly through HDI SCS survey results and quarterly reports.</p>
        <p><strong>Relevant:</strong> Customer satisfaction is one of the most important HDI SCS indicators of service quality and directly reflects how end users view the help desk.</p>

    <div class="goal">
        <h3>Goal 2 – Solve More Issues on the First Call</h3>
        <p><strong>SMART Goal:</strong> From February 1, 2025, to December 31, 2025, we will increase our HDI SCS First Contact Resolution (FCR) rate by 7 percentage points (from 65% to 72%) by strengthening our knowledge base, empowering agents to make decisions, and providing cross-training for common issues.</p>
        <p><strong>Measurement:</strong> FCR will be measured weekly using ticketing system analytics (number of resolved incidents without escalation ÷ total incidents).</p>
        <p><strong>Relevant:</strong> A higher FCR rate reduces repeat tickets, improves efficiency, and provides users with faster, more reliable support.</p>

        <h3>Goal 3 – Resolve Tickets Faster</h3>
        <p><strong>SMART Goal:</strong> From March 1, 2025, to December 31, 2025, we will reduce our HDI SCS Average Resolution Time (MTTR) by 10% compared to last year’s baseline by improving ticket triage, making better use of automation, and addressing repeat issues at the root cause.</p>
        <p><strong>Measurement:</strong> Resolution time will be monitored daily through the ITSM tool and reviewed in monthly trend reports.</p>
        <p><strong>Relevant:</strong> Reducing average resolution time means users get back to work faster, improving productivity and aligning with HDI best practices.</p>

        <p><strong>Measurement:</strong> SLA compliance will be measured monthly using SLA reports from the ITSM system.</p>
        <p><strong>Relevant:</strong> Meeting SLA targets builds trust with stakeholders, shows reliability, and demonstrates accountability.</p>
